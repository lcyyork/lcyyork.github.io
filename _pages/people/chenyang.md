<!--
I grew up in Beijing, the capital of China.
After completing high school at the Affiliated High School of Peking University, I enrolled at Nanjing University where I became interested in computational and theoretical chemistry.
I then persued my doctoral studies under the supervision of Professor Fritz Schaefer at the University of Georgia in the United States.

From 2015 to 2020, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Professor Francesco Evangelista at Emory University.
During this period, we developed a series of multireference electronic structure methods based on the driven similarity renormalization group framework.

In 2021, I joined the College of Chemistry at Beijing Normal University as an associate professor and was promoted to full professor in 2022.
