<!--
I grew up in Beijing, the capital of China.
After completing high school at the Affiliated High School of Peking University, I enrolled at Nanjing University where I became interested in computational and theoretical chemistry.
I then persued my doctoral studies under the supervision of Professor Fritz Schaefer at the University of Georgia in the United States.

From 2015 to 2020, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Professor Francesco Evangelista at Emory University.
During this period, we developed a series of multireference electronic structure methods based on the driven similarity renormalization group framework.

In 2021, I joined the College of Chemistry at Beijing Normal University as an associate professor and was promoted to full professor in 2022.

## Openings
We are continuously seeking talented postdoctoral researchers and highly motivated graduate or undergraduate students with a strong interest in theoretical and computational chemistry to join our group.
Our research focuses on the development, implementation, and application of advanced electronic structure methods, with an emphasis on methodological innovation and high-performance scientific computing.

Prospective applicants who are enthusiastic about electronic structure theory, many-body methods, and computational chemistry are encouraged to contact me by email with a CV and a brief cover letter describing their research interests, relevant experience, and long-term goals.
Postdoctoral applicants should also provide the contact information of two referees who can provide recommendation letters upon request.
