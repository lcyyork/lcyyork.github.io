Modern quantum chemistry research is built on high-performance computing.
In most cases, we run quantum chemistry softwares on multi-core machines with hundreds of gigabytes of memory.

These machines typically run a Linux operating system (e.g., [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) or [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/)).
We access them remotely via SSH and work primarily in a terminal environment.
Therefore, familiarity with Linux and command-line tools is an essential skill for every quantum chemist.

Below are excellent resources to help you get started:

- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (MIT)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

At a minimum, you should be comfortable with:

- **Unix shell** (file system navigation, scripting, job control)
- **Vim** or another terminal-based text editor
- **Git** for version control
- **Python** and **Numpy** for scientific programming

Developing these skills early will make your research significantly more efficient and enjoyable.

If you are currently a Windows user, you are strongly encouraged to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) so that you can work in a Linux environment locally.
