abstract = {Excited-state gradients and derivative couplings are critical for simulating excited-state dynamics. However, their calculations are very expensive within the coupled-cluster framework due to the steep scaling. In this work, we present two implementations of stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 (sRI-CC2) for excited-state analytical gradients and derivative couplings. The first method employs sRI for both Coulomb and exchange terms, reducing the formal scaling to cubic. However, this method has significant stochastic noise. Consequently, we introduce a substitute, termed partial sRI-CC2, which applies sRI selectively to the exchange terms only. The partial sRI-CC2 shows a quartic scaling with a modest prefactor, rendering it a practical alternative. This work is an extension of our previous implementation of the sRI-CC2 method and provides essential ingredients for large-scale nonadiabatic dynamics.},

@article{Zhao2024d,
abstract = {An implementation of stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) approximation to CC2 oscillator strengths and ground state analytical gradients is presented. The essential four-index electron repulsion integral is contracted with a set of stochastic orbitals on the basis of the RI technique and the orbital energy difference in the denominators is decoupled by the Laplace transform. These lead to a significant scaling reduction from O(N<sup>5</sup>) to O(N<sup>3</sup>) for oscillator strengths with the number of basis functions, N. The scaling for gradients can also be reduced to O(N<sup>3</sup>) but this requires a large number of stochastic orbitals and causes a discernible loss of accuracy. Therefore, we provide an O(N<sup>4</sup>) version with better accuracy and smaller prefactor by adopting sRI partially. Such steep computational acceleration of nearly two or one order of magnitude is very attractive for large systems. This work is an extension to our previous implementations of sRI-CC2 ground and excited state energies and shows the feasibility of introducing sRI to CC2 properties beyond energies.},

This active space appears the largest employed to date within the framework of internally contracted multireference formalism. The DMRG-DSRG approach is applied to several challenging systems, including the singlet-triplet gaps (Δ<sub>ST</sub>) of oligoacenes ranging from naphthalene to dodecacene, the vertical excitation energies of zeaxanthin, and the ground-state potential energy curve (PEC) of Cr<sub>2</sub> molecule. Our best estimate for the vertical Δ<sub>ST</sub> of dodecacene is 0.22 eV, showing an excellent agreement with that of the linearized adiabatic connection method (0.24 eV). For zeaxanthin, all DSRG schemes suggest the order of 2 <sup>1</sup>A<sub>g</sub><sup>–</sup> < 1 <sup>1</sup>B<sub>u</sub><sup>+</sup> < 1 <sup>1</sup>B<sub>u</sub><sup>–</sup> for excited states.

abstract = {We present an economical approach to treat spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in the state-averaged driven similarity renormalization group second-order perturbation theory (SA-DSRG-PT2). The electron correlation is first introduced by forming the SA-DSRG-PT2 dressed spin-free Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian is then augmented with the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian and diagonalized using spin-pure reference states to obtain the SOC-corrected energy spectrum. The spin–orbit mean-field approximation is also assumed to reduce the cost associated with the two-electron spin–orbit integrals. The resulting method is termed BP1-SA-DSRG-PT2c, and it possesses the same computational scaling as the non-relativistic counterpart, where only the one- and two-body density cumulants are required to obtain the vertical transition energy. The accuracy of BP1-SA-DSRG-PT2c is assessed on a few atoms and small molecules, including main-group diatomic molecules, transition-metal atoms, and actinide dioxide cations. Numerical results suggest that BP1-SA-DSRG-PT2c performs comparably to other internally contracted multireference perturbation theories with SOC treated using the state interaction scheme.},

The natural orbitals (NOs) are obtained by diagonalizing the one-body reduced density matrix from SA-DSRG second-order perturbation theory (SA-DSRG-PT2). We consider three criteria to truncate the virtual NOs for the subsequent electron correlation treatment beyond SA-DSRG-PT2. An additive second-order correction is applied to the SA-DSRG Hamiltonian to reintroduce correlation effects from the discarded orbitals. The FNO SA-DSRG method is benchmarked on 35 small organic molecules in the QUEST database. When keeping 98–99\% of the cumulative occupation numbers, the mean absolute error in the vertical transition energies due to FNO is less than 0.01 eV. Using the same FNO threshold, we observe a speedup of 9 times compared to the conventional SA-DSRG implementation for nickel carbonyl with a quadruple-ζ basis set. The FNO approach enables nonperturbative SA-DSRG computations on chloroiron corrole [FeCl(C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N<sub>4</sub>)] with more than 1000 basis functions, surpassing the current limit of a conventional implementation.},

We calibrate and test the QDSRG on several challenging chemical problems and propose a strategy for avoiding classical exponential-scaling steps in the QDSRG scheme. We report QDSRG computations of two chemical systems using the variational quantum eigensolver on IBM quantum devices: i) the dissociation curve of H<sub>2</sub> using a quintuple-ζ basis and ii) the bicyclobutane isomerization reaction to trans-butadiene, demonstrating the reduction of problems that require several hundred qubits to a single qubit.

We then assess the accuracy of the SA-DSRG hierarchy using these parameters. The SA-DSRG-PT2 scheme outperforms the level-shifted CASPT2 by 0.10 eV in mean absolute error (MAE), yet this accuracy is slightly inferior than that of CASPT2 with the ionization-potential–electron-affinity shift. Both SA-DSRG-PT3 and SA-sq-LDSRG(2) yield a MAE of 0.10 eV, which is comparable to that of CASPT3 (0.09 eV). Finally, we compute vertical excitation energies of several low-lying singlet states of nucleobases. The SA-sq-LDSRG(2) approach provides highly accurate results for π → π* excitations, while n → π* transitions are better described by SA-DSRG-PT3.},

Phys. 107, 432 (1997)]. This ensemble averages over all microstates of a given total spin quantum number, and therefore, it is invariant with respect to SU(2) transformations. As such, all equations may be reformulated in terms of spin-free quantities and they closely resemble those of spin-adapted closed-shell coupled cluster (CC) theory. The current implementation is used to assess the accuracy of various truncated MR-DSRG methods (perturbation theory up to third order and iterative methods with single and double excitations) in computing the constants of 33 first-row diatomic molecules. The accuracy trends for these first-row diatomics are consistent with our previous benchmark on a small subset of closed-shell diatomic molecules.

abstract = {Lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) have shown promising performance as a sensitizer in infrared-to-visible photon upconversion systems. To investigate the key design rules, we compare three PbS-sensitized upconversion systems using three mediator molecules with the same tetracene triplet acceptor at different distances from the QD. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we directly measure the triplet energy-transfer rates and efficiencies from the QD to the mediator and from the mediator to the emitter. With increasing distance between the mediator and PbS QD, the efficiency of the first triplet energy transfer from the QD to the mediator decreases because of a decrease in the rate of this triplet energy-transfer step, while the efficiency of the second triplet energy transfer from the mediator to the emitter increases because of a reduction in the QD-induced mediator triplet state decay. The latter effect is a result of the slow rate constant of the second triplet energy-transfer process, which is 3 orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion-limited value. The combined results lead to a net decrease of the steady-state upconversion quantum yield with distance, which could be predicted by our kinetic model. Our result shows that the QD/mediator interface affects both the first and second triplet energy transfer processes in the photon upconversion system, and the QD/mediator distance has an opposite effect on the efficiencies of the first and second triplet energy transfer. These findings provide important insight for the further rational improvement of the overall efficiency of QD-based upconversion systems.},

abstract = {This work introduces various approaches to include connected three-body terms in unitary many-body theories, focusing on the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). Starting from the least approximate method—the linearized DSRG truncated to one-, two-, and three-body operators [LDSRG(3)]—we develop several approximate LDSRG(3) models with reduced computational cost. Through a perturbative analysis, we motivate a family of iterative LDSRG(3)-n and -n′ (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) methods that contain a subset of the LDSRG(3) diagrams. Among these variants, the LDSRG(3)-2 scheme has the same computational complexity of coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT), but it outperforms CCSDT in the accuracy of the predicted correlation energies. We also propose and implement two perturbative triples corrections based on the linearized DSRG truncated to one- and two-body operators augmented with recursive semi-quadratic commutators [qDSRG(2)]. The resulting qDSRG(2)+(T) approach matches the accuracy of the “gold-standard” coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples model on the energetics of twenty-eight closed-shell atoms and small molecules.},

abstract = {This study examines several techniques to improve the efficiency of the linearized multireference driven similarity renormalization group truncated to one- and two-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)]. We propose a sequential MR-LDSRG(2) [sq-MR-LDSRG(2)] scheme, in which one-body substitutions are folded exactly into the Hamiltonian. This new approach is combined with density fitting (DF) to reduce the storage cost of two-electron integrals. To further avoid storage of large four-index intermediates, we propose a noninteracting virtual orbital (NIVO) approximation of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff series that neglects commutators terms with three and four virtual indices. The NIVO approximation reduces the computational prefactor of the MR-LDSRG(2), bringing it closer to that of coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD). We test the effect of the DF and NIVO approximations on the MR-LDSRG(2) and sq-MR-LDSRG(2) methods by computing properties of eight diatomic molecules. The diatomic constants obtained by DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO are found to be as accurate as those from the original MR-LDSRG(2) and coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples. Finally, we demonstrate that the DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO scheme can be applied to chemical systems with more than 550 basis functions by computing the automerization energy of cyclobutadiene with a quintuple-ζ basis set. The predicted automerization energy is found to be similar to the value computed with Mukherjee’s state-specific multireference coupled cluster theory with singles and doubles.},

abstract = {We introduce two new approaches to compute near-degenerate electronic states based on the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) framework. The first approach is a unitary multi-state formalism based on the DSRG (MS-DSRG), whereby an effective Hamiltonian is built from a set of state-specific solutions. The second approach employs a dynamic weighting parameter to smoothly interpolate between the multi-state and the state-averaged DSRG schemes. The resulting dynamically weighted DSRG (DW-DSRG) theory incorporates the most desirable features of both multi-state approaches (ability to accurately treat many states) and state-averaged methods (correct description of avoided crossings and conical intersections). We formulate second-order perturbation theories (PT2) based on the MS- and DW-DSRG and study the potential energy curves of LiF, the conical intersection of the two lowest singlet states of NH , and several low-lying excited states of benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. The DW-DSRG-PT2 predicts the correct avoided crossing of LiF and avoids artifacts produced by the corresponding state-specific and multi-state theories. Excitation energies of the acenes computed with the DW-DSRG-PT2 are found to be more accurate than the corresponding state-averaged values, showing a small dependence on the number of states computed. 3},

We apply the resulting method, ACI-DSRG-MRPT2, to predict singlet–triplet gaps, metrics of open-shell character, and spin–spin correlation functions for the oligoacene series (2–7 rings). Our computations employ active spaces with as many as 30 electrons in 30 orbitals and up to 1350 basis functions, yielding gaps that are in good agreement with available experimental results.

abstract={Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in organic semiconductors is of significant technological interest. We present a comprehensive joint experimental and computational study elucidating excited-state dynamics and kinetics of oligothiophenes covalently linked to two radicals. The synthesis, steady-state, and ultrafast photophysics, magnetic properties, computational modeling, and single crystal X-ray diffraction of a series of oligothiophenes with appended nitronyl nitroxide (NN) diradicals (RAx and RBx) are presented. We show that incorporation of the diradicals results in an intriguing molecular packing that is reminiscent of organic cages, unusual excited-state dynamics, and interesting photophysical and magnetic properties. We find an increase in the distance and dihedral angle between the diradical rings and the oligothiophene core result in weak antiferromagnetic interactions. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and computational modeling suggest that efficient conjugation along the backbone leads to an efficient spin-polarization transfer. Insertion of p-phenylene linkers that separate the oligothiophene core from the NN radical component by an average of only 4.3 Å results in a decrease in orbital overlap between the chromophore and singly occupied molecular orbital of the two NN radicals and a weak spin polarization along the thiophene core. Computations also predict a biradical ground state with a small singlet–triplet energy gap (Δ<i>E</i><sub>ST</sub>) of 0.6 kcal/mol or less, where the triplet lies above the singlet, suggesting that in some of these molecules both the singlet and triplet states are thermally populated. Together, the steady-state optical absorption, computational study, and ultrafast transient absorption suggest enhanced internal conversion is the dominant pathway for rapid decay in RAx and RBx diradical series due to two major factors: (i) incorporation of the radicals results in new low-lying singlet and triplet states (S<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>) that act as “trap states”; and (ii) generation of multiple singlet and triplet states that are essentially degenerate in energy. Since incorporation of NN diradicals leads to more than 20 low-lying near degenerate singlet, triplet and quintet states, both intersystem crossing and internal conversion become viable decay mechanisms for the decay of the S<sub>n</sub> and T<sub>n</sub> states back to the S<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>0</sub>. These results establish and correlate structural and electronic parameters that impact spin coupling, spin delocalization, and determine general trends in predicting energy levels of excited states.},

abstract={The multireference driven similarity renormalization group (MRDSRG) approach [C. Li and F. A. Evangelista, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 2097 (2015)] is generalized to treat quasi-degenerate electronic excited states. The new scheme, termed state-averaged (SA) MRDSRG, is a state-universal approach that considers an ensemble of quasi-degenerate states on an equal footing. Using the SA-MRDSRG framework, we implement second- (SA-DSRG-PT2) and third-order (SA-DSRG-PT3) perturbation theories. These perturbation theories can treat a manifold of near-degenerate states at the cost of a single state-specific computation. At the same time, they have several desirable properties: (1) they are intruder-free and size-extensive, (2) their energy expressions can be evaluated non-iteratively and require at most the three-body density cumulant of the reference states, and (3) the reference states are allowed to relax in the presence of dynamical correlation effects. Numerical benchmarks on the potential energy surfaces of lithium fluoride, ammonia, and the penta-2,4-dieniminium cation reveal that the SA-DSRG-PT2 method yields results with accuracy similar to that of other second-order quasi-degenerate perturbation theories. The SA-DSRG-PT3 results are instead consistent with those from multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles (MRCISD). Finally, we compute the vertical excitation energies of (E,E)-1,3,5,7-octatetraene. The ordering of the lowest three states is predicted to be 2 <sup>1</sup>A<sub>g</sub><sup>–</sup> < 1 <sup>1</sup>B<sub>u</sub><sup>+</sup> < 1 <sup>1</sup>B<sub>u</sub><sup>–</sup> by both SA-DSRG-PT2 and SA-DSRG-PT3, in accordance with MRCISD plus Davidson correction.},

Phys. 2014, 141, 054109] based on a generalized reference wave function and operator normal ordering [Kutzelnigg, W.; Mukherjee, D. J. Chem. Phys. 1997, 107, 432]. We perform a perturbative analysis of the corresponding equations at second order and derive a novel multireference perturbation theory, termed DSRG-MRPT2. The DSRG-MRPT2 energy equation can be written in a simple and compact form and can be solved via a noniterative procedure that requires at most the three-body density cumulant of the reference. Importantly, even at the perturbation level, the multireference DSRG is free from the intruder-state problem. We propose an optimal range of the DSRG flow parameter that consistently yields reliable potential energy curves with minimal nonparallelism error. We find that the DSRG-MRPT2 can describe the potential energy curves of HF and N<sub>2</sub>, and the singlet–triplet gap of p-benzyne with an accuracy similar to that of other multireference perturbation theories.},

abstract={The potential energy surface for methylene hindered internal rotation is examined for the n-propyl radical, a molecule fundamental to combustion chemistry. Six stationary points are identified, and four of them are unique: 1, 2, TS1, and TS2. The remaining two structures 1' and TS1' are mirror images with respect to 1 and TS1. Focal point analysis, converged to the complete basis set limit of coupled-cluster theory with single, double, triple, and perturbative quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)], is employed to obtain the relative energies of these structures. A one-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) is constructed by explicitly mapping out a distinguished reaction path via constrained geometry optimizations. A "double-well" feature is observed on the electronic PES, but under the adiabatic approximation, the enthalpic (0 K) PES becomes a regular single-well potential with the expected 180° periodicity. The corresponding one-dimensional vibrational Schrödinger equation is solved using the Cooley–Numerov approach to obtain vibrational states of the methylene torsional motion. The predicted barrier for internal rotation is 105.5 and 137.2 cm<sup>–1</sup> for the electronic and enthalpic surfaces, respectively. Anharmonic (fundamental) vibrational frequencies are predicted for structure 1 using second-order vibrational perturbation theory, and the band origins for 11 modes are reported. Comparison with previous electron spin resonance and infrared spectroscopic work, in addition to other theoretical investigations, is made where possible.},

abstract = {The equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies of the extraordinary [ReH<sub>9</sub>]<sup>2–</sup> dianion (D<sub>3h</sub> symmetry) are investigated using Hartree–Fock (HF) theory, coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD), and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. The new generation of energy-consistent relativistic pseudopotentials and correlation consistent basis sets [cc-pVXZ-PP (Re) and cc-pVXZ (H) (X = D, T, Q)] are used. Anharmonicity was considered using second-order vibrational perturbation theory. The predicted geometries and vibrational frequencies generally agree with experimental findings. In order to stabilize the [ReH<sub>9</sub>]<sup>2–</sup> dianion, the M<sub>2</sub>ReH<sub>9</sub> (M = Na, K) sandwich complexes (D<sub>3h</sub> symmetry) are studied at the CCSD(T)/VTZ (VTZ = cc-pVTZ-PP (Re) and cc-pVTZ (H, Na, K)) level of theory. Compared to the [ReH<sub>9</sub>]<sup>2–</sup> dianion, the predicted vibrational frequencies involving Re–H stretching modes are improved, indicating the importance of considering counterions in electronically dense systems. The natural bond orbital analysis shows that each H atom only bonds with the Re center, and the 5d orbitals of Re and 1s orbitals of H are major factors for the covalent Re–H bonding.},
