## DOI: 10.1002/9780470125915.ch2

This is an introductory review for coupled cluster theory.
I suggest reading this paper before starting Shavitt and Bartlett

This chapter contains sections titled:
- Introduction
- Fundamental Concepts
- Formal Coupled Cluster Theory
- Derivation of the Coupled Cluster Equations
- Connection to Many-Body Perturbation Theory
- Computer Implementation of Coupled Cluster Theory
- Current Research and Future Directions
- Acknowledgments
