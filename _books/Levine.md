Known for its solid presentation of mathematics, this bestseller is a rigorous but accessible introduction to both quantum chemistry and the math needed to master it.
Quantum Chemistry, Seventh Edition covers quantum mechanics, atomic structure, and molecular electronic structure, and provides a thorough, unintimidating treatment of operators, differential equations, simultaneous linear equations, and other areas of required math.
Practical for readers in all branches of chemistry, the new edition reflects the latest quantum chemistry research and methods of computational chemistry, and clearly demonstrates the usefulness and limitations of current quantum-mechanical methods for the calculation of molecular properties.
