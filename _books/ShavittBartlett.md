Written by two leading experts in the field, this book explores the 'many-body' methods that have become the dominant approach in determining molecular structure, properties and interactions.
With a tight focus on the highly popular Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) and Coupled-Cluster theories (CC), the authors present a simple, clear, unified approach to describe the mathematical tools and diagrammatic techniques employed.
Using this book the reader will be able to understand, derive and confidently implement relevant algebraic equations for current and even new multi-reference CC methods.
Hundreds of diagrams throughout the book enhance reader understanding through visualization of computational procedures and extensive referencing allows further exploration of this evolving area.
With an extensive bibliography and detailed index, this book will be suitable for graduates and researchers within quantum chemistry, chemical physics and atomic, molecular and solid-state physics.
